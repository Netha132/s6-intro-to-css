      In September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister
      ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Several BJP leaders,including BJP
      founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were
      "concerned with their personal agendas", expressed opposition to Modi's
      candidature.Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election
      campaign. Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have
      voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial
      candidate.The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP
      election campaign. The election was described as a referendum on Narendra
      Modi.

      Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he
      completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age
      of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he
      abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later
      when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS
      in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose
      through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998. In 2001,
      Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the
      legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered
      complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots, and has been criticised for its
      management of the crisis. According to official records, a little over
      1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent
      sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.A Special Investigation Team
      appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to
      initiate prosecution proceedings against him.While his policies as chief
      minister were credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration
      was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and
      education indices in the state.

      In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency
      in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "the
      Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition
      groups were banned. Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat
      Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the
      Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.Modi was
      forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise
      to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh. He became
      involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending
      them to Delhi and organising demonstrations. He was also involved with
      creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the
      government, and in raising funds for political refugees and
      activists.During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled
      Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In the Struggles of Gujarat), which describes events
      during the Emergency. While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and
      socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political
      figures.

      In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing, and the BJP lost a few
      state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power,
      corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had
      been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in
      2001.[110][112][113] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate
      for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about
      Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[52] Advani did not
      want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience
      in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief
      minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was "going to be
      fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all". On 3 October 2001, Modi
      replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of
      preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[114] On 7
      October, Modi was sworn in[115] and he entered the Gujarat state
      legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II
      constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC

      After the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
      won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Modi was sworn in as Prime
      Minister of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the first Indian PM to be born
      after the country's independence from the British Empire in 1947.[247]
      Modi's second term as PM began in 2019 following the NDA's 2019 Lok Sabha
      election win. On 6 December 2020, he became the fourth-longest-serving
      Prime Minister of India and the longest-serving non-Congress prime
      minister.
